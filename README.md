# Predicting_the_Probability_of_Influenza_Vaccine_Uptake_using_Machine_Learning_Methods

This project analyzes the data set which is the result 
of the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS). More than twenty 
thousand participants from the USA were asked questions about 
their basic information and opinions about H1N1 and seasonal 
vaccinations. The goal of this project is to predict the rates of 
individuals receiving the two kinds of vaccinations. The two authors used different data preprocessing methods, 
selected different features and used 5 different machine learning 
models to predict the likelihood of individuals receiving H1N1 and 
seasonal influenza vaccines. Finally, the prediction accuracy of 
each other is compared by calculating relevant indicators. The 
results show that the decision tree regression not only has high 
prediction accuracy but also runs fast in dealing with the problem 
of this high-dimensional data set.
